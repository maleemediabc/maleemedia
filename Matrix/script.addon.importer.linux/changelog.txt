18/05/2022 Deleted the now defunct Fen and its repository and 
installed the new replacement fork Ezra addon with optimised settings.
You will need to click yes when it asks  you to download Ezra.
You will likely need to reauthorise Trakt and Real Debrid for Ezra which
you can of course carry out easily in the Box Settings program addon.
