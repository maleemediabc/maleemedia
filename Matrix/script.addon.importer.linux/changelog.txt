[COLOR red]**NOTE** When all updates have finished installing (no more update notices appear in the
top right of your screen), then reboot cleanly by selecting the power option at the top left
of your screen & choose "Reboot". You may need to authorise Trakt & Real Debrid for newly
installed video addons, easily carried out using our special "Box Settings" program addon.[/COLOR]

[COLOR yellow]17/10/2022 *LATEST* Added a new program "Thumbnail Cache Cleaner" a useful
utility to remove the many unneeded thumbnail files clogging up your box's memory, with
credit to Tiki. Just select how many past days you wish to keep the cached thumbnails
for, recommend set to 5 days but up to you. Worth running this utility at least monthly
to keep your system running smoothly and fast. Useful just before regular full back ups
of your system to keep them as small as possible.

*REMINDER* Don't forget to look at the regularly updated Google Drive addon for our latest
superb collection of high quality music concerts to suit all tastes from rock to classical
exclusive for our Malee Media customers. When launched, select "Malee Media Drive" then
click on the option "Shared With Me". Includes a special Ray's Video VJ selection, by
clicking the remote menu button on the first track, choose "Play From Here" and it will
continously auto play each track in order until stopped. This feature is regularly updated.[/COLOR]

26/09/2022 Added new exclsuive music addon "FMStream". This will allow
you to listen to Radio stations from all over the world in good quality. Enjoy 

13/07/2022 Removed old Resolveurl version & installed the latest version by forcing 4K
addon to update & auto install the new Resolveurl working version. Don't forget to
reboot, then the Oath, Shadow, 4K and Magic Dragon addons will all work again.
