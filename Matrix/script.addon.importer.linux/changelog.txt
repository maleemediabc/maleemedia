18/05/2022 Deleted the now recently closed down Fen addon and its repository
and installed the new replacement Ezra repository and addon all set up with 
optimised settings. 

Once all the updates have finished installing (no more update notices are seen
in the top right of your screen), then reboot cleanly by selecting the power
option at the top left of your wceen and choose the Reboot option.

Once rebooted it will ask if you want to download and install the Ezra addon to
which you should select "Yes". The new Ezra addon will auto install and enable.
You may need to reauthorise Trakt and Real Debrid for Ezra which you can of
course carry out easily in the Box Settings program addon.  Enjoy
