[COLOR red]**NOTE** When all updates have finished installing (no more update notices appear in the
top right of your screen), then reboot cleanly by selecting the power option at the top left
of your screen & choose "Reboot". You may need to authorise Trakt & Real Debrid for newly
installed addons. This can be carried out easily in the new Box Settings program addon.[/COLOR]

[COLOR yellow]13/07/2022 *LATEST* Removed old Resolveurl version & installed the latest version by
forcing 4K addon to update & auto install the new Resolveurl working version. Don't
