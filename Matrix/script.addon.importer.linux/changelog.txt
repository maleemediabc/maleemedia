30/01/2022 Added Startup background auto running addon and the new 
KODI Settings.addon which you will find in your Program addons.

18/05/2022 Deleted the now defunct Fen and its repository and 
installed the new replacement fork Ezra addon with optimised settings
but you will probably need to reauthorise Trakt and Real Debrid which
you can of course carry out easily in the Box Settings program addon.
